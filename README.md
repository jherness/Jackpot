Slot Machine Game (Assignment)
This project was created as part of a technical assignment. The task was to develop a slot machine game with a unique twist, leveraging real-time communication between the frontend and backend.

Features:
Slot Machine Game: A basic implementation of a slot machine game with an added twist to make the gameplay more interesting.
WebSocket Communication: The game communicates with the server in real-time using WebSocket technology, ensuring smooth and instant updates.
Node.js Server:
 The backend is powered by a Node.js server, handling game logic and client connections. Initially, I attempted to use a Python server, but due to some integration challenges, I pivoted to Node.js.
React Frontend:
 The user interface is built using React, providing a dynamic and responsive experience for players.

To-Do/Improvements:
Design better React GUI,
Remove unnecessary code, particularly in the frontend, to improve readability and maintainability.
Set 'Blocks' as React Functional Component.
Challenges:
While working on this project, I encountered some difficulties, particularly with the initial Python server setup and its integration with the frontend. However, these challenges allowed me to learn and adapt, ultimately leading to a functional Node.js WebSocket server.
