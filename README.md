Jackpot app with a Twist!

After carefully reading the assignment and visualizing it, I've decided to use the following technologies:
Client - React. Besides being a library I feel comfortable with, it provides a powerful, flexible, and efficient way to build modern
         web applications, making it a great choice for this assignment. 
Server - Python. Python's is a great choice for building a client-server multithreaded server because of its:
         Ease of use, readability, multithreading capabilities, cross-platform support and integration with other technologies.
DB     - SQLite. We need a database, even if it's a Mock DB, to save the credentials and score of the users. Therefore, it (The database) 
         needs to be lightweight, local, offer simplicity, efficiency, and ease of use.

Client-Server communication will be performed using the JSON format, which is excellent for this purpose because it's lightweight, easy to read and write, and language-independent.
